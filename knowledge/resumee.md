The following is the curriculum vitae of Alexander Knips
# About Alexander (Title: PhD)
Alexander's passion for science led him to study physics, culminating in a PhD in computational biophysics in 2015. His programming journey commenced in childhood, and he financed his physics degree by working part-time as a software engineer from 2007 on-wards.

With 16 years of experience as a professional software developer, Alexander's diverse expertise, backed by a PhD and scientific background, empowers him to tackle intricate technical and scientific challenges. His passion extends across projects, ranging from full-stack web development and software architecture to machine learning and DevOps.

Post-PhD, he developed a neural network-based product for retail before shifting to full-stack engineering due to funding challenges in the Munich startup scene. In 2016, Alexander immersed himself in NLP and parsing in supply chain management, securing a senior backend engineer role as a contractor with Karius, an emerging biotech startup. His journey extended to the U.S. in 2021, where he assumed the role of tech lead, Senior Staff Software Engineer, in the same company's order-to-report segment.

Location: Munich, Germany, remote, Client in Redwood City, USA
As a senior software engineer at Karius, I led the development of internal and customer-facing portals using ASP.NET Core in \Csharp. Additionally, I contributed to the in-house LIMS system's development in Scala and collaborated on components and APIs with the Illumina LIMS system, using Scala and Python. Played a key role in planning and executing a back-end rewrite using domain-driven design principles in Scala. Furthermore, I introduced end-to-end testing platforms (Cypress) alongside existing unit and API tests. Extensive experience in keeping the software stack running in a life-critical environment. DevOps usage and improvements using kustomize.

# Side-projects
## Vanapp, NestJS, NextJS, OpenAI API - Fullstack, Machine Learning
Location: Redwood City, USA
Collabortation with vendors of van conversion products, scraping their product catalog and categorizing items using the OpenAI embeddings API to fit into pre-defined categories and sub-categories. The UI features a questionnaire influencing product presentation based on a calculated configuration, yet more features are necessary. Originally a Next.js app, later transitioned the API to Nest.js for improved handling of background jobs such as scraping and categorization.

## ZDB Bonn, IT work

Location: Bonn, Germany
Helping with IT of a organization helping kids with Dyscalculia.

## TCGW, Wedsite, Tennisclub, PHP, Drupal, Joompla, Wordpress, 2003--2015
