 With 16 years of experience as a software engineer and a scientific background, I am confident in my ability to contribute effectively to your team and accelerate the company toward its ultimate goal of achieving artificial general intelligence.

In my current role as Senior Staff Software Engineer at Karius I successfully transitioned a significant portion of the engineering team from using their favorite flavor-of-the-month tech stack to a software stack that is productive, pragmatic, and maintainable. Domain Driven Design, Clean Coding principles, Event Driven software design, reactive programming, and functional programming have all played a significant role in this transition. I was also instrumental in improving the usability of our Kubernetes story for the engineers.

My experience in High-Performance Computing with the help of GPUs during my PhD thesis, the hands-on usage of machine learning and deep neural networks on multiple occasions, together with extensive experience as a back-end software engineer with knowledge of DevOps, testing, and architecture, have equipped me with the expertise needed to excel in a dynamic and challenging environment.

Thank you for considering my application. I am excited about the prospect of joining OpenAI and contributing to your team's success.
