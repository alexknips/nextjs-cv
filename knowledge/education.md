The following is the curriculum vitae of Alexander Knips

# Education
## 2012--2015: PhD in physics
Technische Universitaet Muenchen
Location: Munich, Germany
Grade: 1.3 (best Grade 1.0)
Focus: Theoretical bio-physics, molecular-dynamics  simulations.
PhD thesis: Recognition of UV-induced DNA Damage - A Molecular Dynamics Analysis
During his PhD large scale High Perfomance Computing simulations were used. Here it was necessary to understand algorithms, optimize them and even move some of the algorithms from CPU to GPUs or even implement some algorithms from scratch. The computer simulations involve Monte Carle and Molecular Dynamics simulations. 
## 2005--2011: Diploma (masters) in physics
Universitaet Bonn
Location: Bonn, Germany
Grade: 1.3 (best Grade 1.0)
Focus: Theoretical condensed matter physics.
Diploma thesis: Transport properties of multi-level quantum-dots coupled to normal metals and superconductors
## 2008--2009: Exchange program
Australian National University
Location: Canberra, Australia
Grade: High Distinction (HD), best grade
## 2003--2005: Program Foerdern, fordern, forschen
Universitaet Bonn
Location: Bonn, Germany
Successful participation in a university program for high school students in the following classes: Experimental physics II, Linear Algebra I and II, Analysis I and II, Astronomy I.
## 1996--2005: Abitur (high school)
Carl-von-Ossietzky-Gymnasium
Location: Bonn, Germany
Grade: 1.1 (best Grade 1.0)
