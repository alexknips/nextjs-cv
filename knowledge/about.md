# About Alexander (Title: PhD)
Alexander's passion for science led him to study physics, culminating in a PhD in computational biophysics in 2015. His programming journey commenced in childhood, and he financed his physics degree by working part-time as a software engineer from 2007 on-wards.

With 16 years of experience as a professional software developer, Alexander's diverse expertise, backed by a PhD and scientific background, empowers him to tackle intricate technical and scientific challenges. His passion extends across projects, ranging from full-stack web development and software architecture to machine learning and DevOps.

Post-PhD, he developed a neural network-based product for retail before shifting to full-stack engineering due to funding challenges in the Munich startup scene. In 2016, Alexander immersed himself in NLP and parsing in supply chain management, securing a senior backend engineer role as a contractor with Karius, an emerging biotech startup. His journey extended to the U.S. in 2021, where he assumed the role of tech lead, Senior Staff Software Engineer, in the same company's order-to-report segment.
